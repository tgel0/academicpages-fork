Recently I volunteered at the [PyData Berlin 2018 conference](https://pydata.org/berlin2018/). It's been a blast!

With more than 500 participants over 3 days this was the largest PyData conference in Europe! I would like to thank the whole community for making this such a great experience!

As a volunteer, I was mostly doing the so called 'Runner' job which meant that I was basically supporting the organizers and other volunteers whenever needed.

I was also lucky enough to catch a few very interesting talks when I was off duty. Below are some photos I took during the conference.

Interesting talk from [Dr. Thorben Jensen](https://pydata.org/berlin2018/speaker/profile/15/) about hyperparameter tuning
