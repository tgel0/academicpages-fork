### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a data nerd based in Berlin interested in all-things-data, startups and [Swedish EDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHg2zHfCsk). I have 4+ years of professional experience working in the area of [service operation](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/ITIL_Service_Operation) for various companies from the banking and automotive area.
