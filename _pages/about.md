### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a data nerd based in Berlin and interested in data science and machine learning. After doing some consulting for banks for a few years I'm now looking for a new challenge! If you would like to find out more, check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RrQ8oCcvxQQVsmNG_qkfe0MkuVqxEjEC).

### News:

- I started a series of blog posts where I'm writing about all the things I'm building with the Spotify Web API. The first post is called "Spotify Data Project Part 1 - from Data Retrieval to First Insights" and has been published by [Towards Data Science on Medium,com](https://towardsdatascience.com/spotify-data-project-part-1-from-data-retrieval-to-first-insights-f5f819f8e1c3)! Alternatively, you can also read it [on my personal blog](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/spotify-data-project-part-1-from-data-retrieval-to-first-insights/)

- Following my 10.000th tweet on Twitter I did some data analysis and visualization and wrote a [blog post about it](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/10-visualizations/)

- Recently, I started out with Kaggle - check out my [Kaggle profile page](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo) or my first official competition notebook [here](https://github.com/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/KaggleSantanderValuePrediction.ipynb)

- I volunteered at the PyData Berlin 2018 Conference! In [this blog post](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/pydata-berlin-2018/) I summarized this awesome experience
