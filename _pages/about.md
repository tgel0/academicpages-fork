I'm a Data Nerd learningÂ how (to make) machines learn.

Here are some things I've been working on recently:

- Starting out with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), after getting a public score of 0.818 in the [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/titanic-with-family-survival-tpot-0-81818) (top 4% in the public leaderboard at the time of submission), my [first attempt](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/benchmark-model-with-lgbm-1-48) on the Santander challenge got an RMSLE of 1.48 (top  65%)(spoiler alert: I'm working on an improved solution which is close to breaking into the top 25%)

- I volunteered at the PyData Berlin 2018 Conference! In [this blog post](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/pydata-berlin-2018/) I summarized this awesome experience by adding a few photos I took during the weekend
