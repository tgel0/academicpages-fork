I'm a Data Nerd learningÂ how (to make) machines learn.

Here are some things I've been working on recently:

- In order to get some more practical experience with Python and Data Science I recently started with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions: my [Titanic kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/titanic-with-family-survival-tpot-0-81818) made it into the top 4% (at the time of submission), currently I'm working on the Santander challenge after [my benchmark model](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/benchmark-model-with-lgbm-1-48) achieved a pretty good RMSLE of 1.48

- I volunteered at the PyData Berlin 2018 Conference! In [this blog post](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/pydata-berlin-2018/) I summarized this awesome experience by adding a few photos I took during the weekend
