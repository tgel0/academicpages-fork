I'm a Data Scientist on a learning sabbatical. Currently I'm learningÂ how (to make) machines learn.

Here are my latest projects:

- ### Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Notebook - Spotify Data

I used unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA to cluster and visualize audio features data collected from the official Spotify Web API. [github link](https://github.com/tgel0/tgel0.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/SpotifyUnsupervised.ipynb) and [nbviewer link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tgel0/tgel0.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/SpotifyUnsupervised.ipynb)
