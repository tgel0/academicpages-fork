### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a full-stack data nerd based in Berlin interested in all-things-data, startups and Swedish EDM. I have 4+ years of professional experience working in the area of IT Helpdesk for various companies from the banking and automotive area.


### News:

- Following up on the previous article, I wrote about serverless-ing (is that even a word?) my Spotify data project and called it ["A Whole New World: Going Serverless with GCP (Aladdin-style)"](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/A-Whole-New-World-Going-Serverless-with-GCP-Aladdin-Style/) (you'll have to read it to find out about the Aladdin reference)

- I wrote an article about setting up a basic data retrieval pipeline called "Spotify Data Project Part 1 - from Data Retrieval to First Insights" which has been republished by [Towards Data Science on Medium.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/spotify-data-project-part-1-from-data-retrieval-to-first-insights-f5f819f8e1c3)! Alternatively, you can also read it here [on my personal blog](https://tgel0.github.io/blog/spotify-data-project-part-1-from-data-retrieval-to-first-insights/)
