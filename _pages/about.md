I'm a Data Scientist on a learning sabbatical. Currently I'm learningÂ how (to make) machines learn.

Here are my latest projects:

- Spotify Cluster Analysis - I used unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA to cluster and visualize audio features data collected from the official Spotify Web API. Notebook available on [github](https://github.com/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SpotifyUnsupervised.ipynb) or as [nbviewer link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SpotifyUnsupervised.ipynb)
