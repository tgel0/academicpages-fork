I'm a Data Nerd learningÂ how (to make) machines learn.

Here are some recent updates:

- I volunteered at the PyData Berlin 2018 Conference! In [this blog post](https://tgel0.github.io/posts/2018/pydata-berlin-2018/) I summarized this awesome experience by adding a few photos I took during the weekend

- Spotify Cluster Analysis - I used unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA to cluster and visualize audio features data collected from the official Spotify Web API. Notebook available on [github](https://github.com/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SpotifyUnsupervised.ipynb) or as [nbviewer link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/SpotifyUnsupervised.ipynb)
